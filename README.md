# DESI tutorials

This repository is for tutorials on simulating and working with DESI data.
There are additional more detailed tutorials within many of the DESI code
repositories.  Tutorials in this repository are generally for:
* Topics that span individual repositories, e.g. working with data challenge outputs
* Tutorials to be presented at a collaboration meeting where we want to decouple
  updates to the tutorial itself from the desispec, desisim, etc. code versions that
  the tutorial is describing.

# For authors of tutorials

Include at the beginning of the tutorial what is needed as a prerequsite for running the tutorial,
e.g. specific codes, environment variables, datasets.  It's OK to link elsewhere for detailed
instructions (e.g. for how to install DESI code in general).
